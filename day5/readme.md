# Day 5

## Part 1

Reduce the polymer string until it no longer needs to react. Then count how many units are remaining in the polymer.

```bash
./polymer.escript input.data
```

Alternatively if you do not have `escript` in PATH:

```bash
escript polymer.escript input.data
```

## Part 2

Find the most problematic unit type by removing all occurences of it and reacting the polymers. The most problematic type is the one with the least units remaining after it has been fully reacted. The output is the length of the remaining polymer.

```bash
./polymer.escript input.data
```

Alternatively if you do not have `escript` in PATH:

```bash
escript polymer.escript input.data
```
