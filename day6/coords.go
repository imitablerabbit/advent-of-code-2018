// Find largest x and y coords so we can get the size of the array

// Create array and fill it up with the calculated manhatten distance for all of the coordinates

// Loop through and find the coordinate with the lowest value

// Loop through and calculate the areas for all of the coords

// If we reach the bounds of the array, then it is an infinitely sprawling one.
